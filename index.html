                      &mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the
                      presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more successful
                      than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross
                      Perot isn't successful like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci
                      store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and
                      haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know
                      it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your
                      fault.

                      Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan
                      Spitalny: no grades, certificates and other bureaucracy,
                      but program offered courses in real estate, asset
                      management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98%
                      students gave positive reviews while studying, however
                      some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against
                      Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25
                      million to settle that...

                      Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River,

                      sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the

                      Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle. What a

                      Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold my very

                      it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the
                      Mona Lisa" and sold it for a lot of cash in 1995)

                      I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it
                      into a private club.You can join if you pay $200K
                      initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for
                      members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I
                      also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana
                      became a manager, because she is another Trump!

                      I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football
                      team. I changed team's play schedule and filed an
                      antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League,
                      so NJG are not doing so good now, but back then they were

                      Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in
                      Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented Polish workers
                      to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including
                      art deco features. All this to make architectural critic
                      Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is
                      "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed
                      in New York in some years". At the same time I also
                      started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park
                      and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million,
                      which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!
